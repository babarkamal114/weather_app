     - Store
     - Styles

## Dicussions 
I have called the homepage.js component, which renders the home page, in App.js. 
I divided the home page into various sections, much like the modal components, where each component was organised 
separately and given the right name.

I've created a skeleton component for the API fetching case and called it from within the home page while on loading request.

You may find the current weather component there, where I have the current day's forecast coded. Same for Five days forecast
I have kept in FiveDayForecast component.
If you click on the day forecast, it will redirect you to another route. For that, I have renderedÂ the ForecastSelected component.

I have kept the action and reducer files inside the home page dir, as this was a small task, but for big projects it's a bit harder to
find the actions and reducers. If we have more pages, it's going to be simple and easy for others to find the relevant files.


## How to use the app
The first element, I have shown the city name and date, was extracted from the API response.
I also implemented a search bar, which will fetch data by city. (e.g. London, York, Coventry).
By default, I have called the provided URL from the task document.

Below the city/search bar I have shown the current day's forecast.

Below this section I have displayed the five day forecast card, which is clickable. and it will show the specific day's selected data.


## UI/UX Figma
As this was a small task, I quickly draw some paper for idea and designed the High fiedelty prototype. And tested the prototype with only
one user.
